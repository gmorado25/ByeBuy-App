# ByeBuy-App
ByeBuy is a mobile app designed to reshape how users think about money, time, and value. Instead of simply displaying a product’s price, ByeBuy helps users visualize how many work hours it would take to afford something based on their post-tax income. Users can also explore how that same amount, if invested, could grow over time until retirement. Whether you’re deciding if a purchase is worth the effort or curious about the long-term value of saving, WorkWorth empowers smarter spending decisions and builds awareness around time-value tradeoffs. Perfect for young professionals, students, or anyone striving for financial mindfulness.
